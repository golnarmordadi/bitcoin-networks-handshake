# Repository Title: Bitcoin Node Handshake Crawler

Description:

The Bitcoin Node Handshake Crawler is a Rust-based tool designed to establish and verify peer connections within the Bitcoin network. This tool initiates the Bitcoin handshake process, collects peer addresses from connected nodes, and recursively explores the network to discover additional peers. The primary objective of this project is to improve the efficiency and scalability of peer discovery in the Bitcoin network.
