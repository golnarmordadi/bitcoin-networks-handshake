# Improvement

To improve and scale the node address collection system, several design patterns can be effectively applied. Each pattern addresses specific challenges related to concurrency, scaling, and error handling. Hereâ€™s a summary of useful design patterns:

1- Observer Pattern: Implement observers that listen for new addresses and update their state or trigger further actions. This can help in managing and processing addresses as they are collected.

2- Producer-Consumer Pattern: Use channels or queues to pass addresses from producers (crawling tasks) to consumers (address processing and storage). This helps in handling high throughput and maintaining efficient data processing.

3- Decorator Pattern: Enhance their capabilities dynamically.

4- Retry Pattern: Improve robustness by retrying failed operations to handle temporary network issues gracefully.

5- Circuit Breaker Pattern: Allowing the system to recover and avoid cascading failures.

6- Load Balancer Pattern: This ensures even distribution of network traffic and processing tasks.

7- Microservices Pattern: Divide the node address collection system into microservices, such as a crawler service, a processor service, and a storage service. This allows for better scalability and maintainability.

8- Strategy Pattern: Implement different strategies for crawling and address selection, allowing the system to choose the most appropriate one based on context or configuration.

9- Pipeline Pattern:  Process data through a series of stages or transformations.

10- Using native packages and decreasing dependency to the external packages. However, it's important to balance the benefits of reduced dependencies with the convenience and functionality provided by well-established libraries. This offers different benefits:

- Reduced Binary Size
- Improve Security
- Better Performance
- Easier Maintenance
- Greater Control

As an Example:

- Use Standard Library for Networking: `std::net::TcpStream` and `std::time::Duration` instead of `tokio::net::TcpStream` and `tokio::time::timeout` where possible.

- Implement a custom codec for Bitcoin messages using the standard library or minimal dependencies instead of `tokio_util::codec::Framed`.

- Use std::env::args for command-line argument parsing instead of clap::Parser for simple argument parsing.
